# NUS ECE lecture
This is a material for two lecture sessions about Predictive Maintenance. Link for dataset: Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set, under https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/.

Please proceed to the [Notebook](https://github.com/iceberg12/NUS_guest_lecture/blob/master/EE5110/Prognostics%20Prediction.ipynb) for details. The data should be loaded from this [Input](https://github.com/iceberg12/NUS_guest_lecture/tree/master/input) folder.

Proposed Procedure:
1. Install Anaconda for Python 3, and Git.
2. Git clone this git folder.
3. Read the materials to understand about predictive maintenance for jet engines.
4. Open Jupyter Notebook and run through the notebook and answer questions.
5. Perform training and testing on all the four datasets to understand the difference among them.
6. * Additional bonus: download the PHM08 dataset from the NASA link above and explore using the same method.
7. Write report of 10 pages and submit before 28/09/2019 11:59:59 PM.
8. Send the code and report to tuanminh.nus@gmail.com
